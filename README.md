# UTA Coding Bootcamp Challenge  -- Tech Blog

## Description

This is my submission for the Tech Blog challenge in the UTA/EdX Coding Bootcamp. This challenge aimed to create a website that can connect to a database and allow users to log in and out, post blog entries, update or delete those entries, and comment on other posts.

## Usage

The site opens on a homepage that displays all blog posts in the database. Clicking on any post will pull up any comments made on the post. The site has a navbar with home, dashboard, and login options. The dashboard is only available when the user is logged in. If the user is not, they will be redirected to the login page. From this page, there is also a link to sign up if the user does not have an account. Once logged in, the user can access the dashboard, which displays their posts and offers the option to create a new post. The user can click on any existing post to edit or delete the post. While logged in, the user can also comment on other users' posts by navigating to them via the homepage and clicking the "new comment" button. While logged in, the login link in the navbar is switched to a logout button.
